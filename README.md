OOP Class

Files related to the course will go in this repository (probably).

The CalculatorApp folder contains all 4 changed files needed for the assignment.

The YahooStockApp folder contains all of the necessary files to recreate the layout, colors and gradients, and styles for the app. I uploaded AndroidManifest.xml and MainActivity.java just in case they were needed for it to work correctly, but I don't think we added anything in them other than the code for web scraping which isn't needed for the style of the app.
